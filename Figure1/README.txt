- Data sets can be loaded from the folder Data_Sets in this repo. 
- Run TMI to output the Kullback-Leibler divergence.
- We use the package released by Martino et al. (https://github.com/biocore/gemelli) to perform compositional tensor factorization, see SI section 4.

- The data is generated in silico using the multispecies Lotka-Volterra model described in SI section 2. The code is given in the file 'GLV_run'
- We compare with CTF in the same manner as in 1b.
