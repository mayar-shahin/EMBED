These codes are for reproducing figure 2. 

## Figure 2a
- 'Fig2a.m' loads the data from the parent folder and performs the learning and saves results into a data file to be used for analysis.
Running on a regular compuer should be close to 7 minutes. Hyperparameters are included in the file.
The file performs two runs of the learning to check for reproducability (SI Fig 1)

## Figure 2b
- 'Fig2b.m'picks OTUs that are plotted on Figure 2b. Individual OTUs can then be plotted using the abundance data stored in variable 'x'


## Figure 2c
- 'Fig2c.m' reproduces the clustergram in Figure 2c. Individual groups can then be plotted using the abundance data stored in variable 'x'


## Figure 2d
- 'Fig2d.m' reproduces the 2 plots in Figure 2d.
